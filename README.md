Indentations are necessary to make the code look professional and readable. As it is not a prominent practice, we often skip such beautifications and ignore them, leaving a wrong impression on the reader's mind. This is a program that detects incorrect indentation in any given C++ file. It can be integrated with various IDEs and act as an extension that detects and corrects improper indents in the code.
It has been made with basic libraries of python, which includes implementation of stacks data structure and file I/O methods. It covers all the test cases, even when there is a curly bracket inside a comment in between the C++ code. We assume that your C++ code compiles. If there is any extra curly bracket in the code, then the program is expected to throw incorrect results.
 
## **How to Run:**
Simply put the _code.py_ file in the same folder as your C++ file, and replace _"test.cpp"_ in line number '8' of the python file with the name of your C++ file. Then simply run the python script, and it will do your work.
